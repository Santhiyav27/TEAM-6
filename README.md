# ü§ñ AI-Powered Chatbot for HR, IT & Policy Queries (with Restricted Document Access) 

## üìå Project Overview

This is an **AI-powered intelligent chatbot system** designed for **public sector organizations**, enabling employees to get **instant answers** to HR, IT, and policy-related queries. What makes this chatbot unique is its **document-aware access control**‚Äîusers must upload the correct document to access sensitive content.

The system leverages **Google Gemini AI** and **ChromaDB** for intelligent question answering based on context from either **public** or **restricted** documents. It's a secure, scalable, and accurate solution aimed at improving organizational productivity and reducing repetitive queries.

## üîß Problem Statement

### ‚ùó Existing Issues Faced by Organizations:
- Employees wait long to get answers from HR or IT departments.
- Teams are burdened by answering the same repetitive questions.
- Company documents are often buried or hard to search.
- Sensitive policies lack proper access control.

### ‚ùå Current Solutions Are Inefficient:
- Old HR portals are outdated and non-intuitive.
- Generic chatbots fail to understand company-specific policies.
- Email-based support is slow and not scalable.

## ‚úÖ Our Solution

We‚Äôve built a **context-aware AI chatbot** that:
- Uses **Google Gemini AI** to answer user questions accurately.
- Differentiates between **public** and **restricted** documents.
- Allows access to sensitive content **only when the correct file is uploaded**.
- Delivers responses **within seconds**.
- Can scale to **multiple users** without performance drops.

## üß† Core Features

- ‚ö° **Fast Response Time** ‚Äì Under 5 seconds per query.
- üß© **Smart AI** ‚Äì Powered by Google Gemini for natural conversation.
- üîê **Access Control** ‚Äì Sensitive content shown only after document verification.

cd TEAM-6
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up Python Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scriptsctivate
```

python ingest_docs.py
```



### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Start Backend Server

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

To run in Localhost(connect multiple device over same network)
```bash
Python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000¬†--reload
```
Change the the ip address to your ip address in the app.js so that I will be hosted in your laptop then nearby system connected in the same wifi can also load the page bye pasting the url (given after running app.js )in the browser.

# In another terminal
```bash
cd frontend/frontend
npm install
npm start
```
